# Batchnet
The Batch Version Of The Internet! Yay!

If you want to use it this is how it works:

1. Unzip the zip file
2. Open "Batchnet (32 bit)" or "Batchnet (64 bit)"
3. If you want to create a website in this program, go to the batchnet website "6vydPw0F" for the commands. And goto "kNDGhz34" to find out how to host a website.
